1. **The "Bio-Sense" Smart Litter Mat**
A sleek, low-profile mat that sits in front of the litter box. It uses weight sensors and thermal imaging to track a cat’s weight and bathroom frequency, sending health alerts to an app if it detects early signs of kidney issues or diabetes (common in older cats).

2. **Augmented Reality (AR) Laser Tower**
A stationary hub that projects laser patterns or "digital mice" onto the floor. Instead of random movement, it syncs with a mobile app so owners can control the laser remotely via their phone screen, or set "AI-driven" hunt patterns that mimic real prey behavior.

3. **Modular "Sky-Track" shelving**
A system of minimalist, magnetic-mount wall hexes and bridges. Unlike permanent wooden shelves, these allow renters to rearrange their cat's vertical "highway" without drilling new holes every time, using high-strength industrial adhesive backing.

4. **Ultrasonic "Purr-Sync" Calming Pod**
A small, pebble-shaped device that emits low-frequency haptic vibrations and subsonic frequencies that mimic a mother cat’s purr. It is designed to be placed in a cat's favorite bed to reduce separation anxiety for cats whose owners work long hours.

5. **The "Fresh-Catch" Hydroponic Nibbler**
A self-contained, automated hydroponic planter specifically for cat grass and silvervine. It uses a small UV light and a silent water pump to ensure the grass is always succulent and soil-free, preventing the "knocked over dirt" mess common with standard pots.

6. **Carbon-Filter "Privacy Tunnel"**
A stylish, sound-dampened entry tunnel that attaches to any standard litter box. It uses industrial-grade activated carbon honeycomb filters to trap 99% of odors before they leave the box, while providing the cat a "dark-zone" for security.
