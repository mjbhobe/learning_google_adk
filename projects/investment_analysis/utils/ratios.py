    Revenue & growth metrics are intended to measure business growth, profitability, earnings potential, 
    financial stability, and cash flow generation of a company.
    These can be interpreted as follows (though the interpretation could differ person-to-person)
        - Revenue Growth (%) - measures revenue growth across years. >10% is strong growth,
            5-10% is moderate growth, <5% is slow growth, and negative is revenue decline (avoid!)

            profitability growth, 5-10% is moderate growth, <5% is slow growth and negative means declining
            profitability (avoid!). Positive values indicate company is becoming more profitable.
        - EPS Growth (%) - measures how fast the company's earnings are increasing on a per-share basis.
            >15% means strong EPS growth (great for investors), 5-15% means moderate but stable growth,
            0-5% means slow earnings expansion and <0% (negative) means declining EPS (avoid!)
        - FCF Growth (%) - shows whether company is generating more "excess cash flow" over time.
            >15% means strong cash flows (company can invest & pay dividends), 5-15% means moderate growth & stable cash generation, 0-5% means low growth (cash flow stagnation) and negative means declining FCF (bad for investment - avoid!)
        - Net Profit Margin (%) - measures the profitability of a company.
            >10% means healthy profitability, 5-10% means sustainable profitability, 0-5% means thin margins, and negative means loss making business (avoid!)
        - Earnings Per Share (EPS) - measures profit earned by the company per share.
            Increasing EPS means company is growing profits per share - look for Y-on-Y values.
            Declining EPS means EPS is shrinking & this company should be avoided.
        - Debt to Equity (D/E) - measures debt-burden risk for a company
            <1.0 means healthy leverage (debt burden is low, hence good)
            1.0 - 2.0 usually means moderate risk, but varies by industry
            > 2.0 implies high debt burden (risky & should be avoided!)
